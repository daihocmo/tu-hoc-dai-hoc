Stage 2: Build Comprehension
----------------------------

### 2A: Overcoming the Curve

-   2A: Simplified Video Content

    -   Streaming Services

        -   [ZDF](https://www.zdf.de/kinder): Lots of children's content (and regular content). VPN is needed to access.

        -   [ARD Mediathek](https://www.ardmediathek.de/): You can find a huge variety of series, movies and documentaries among other things. There is a lot of content with CC, although for some you will need a VPN. Anyway, there is a lot of open content!

    -   Native with matching subs

        -   [Extr@](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6khA8eZaD4&list=PLM45RE_YsqS5-S58HSmYOhu2m-tRul9jW&index=1): a sitcom aimed at beginners to German; it follows three Germans living in an apartment block & the American tourist that stays a while. The language is very accessible, and the characters often illustrate words to the American through mime. It's corny but really fun. The subtitles are listed as Dutch on the youtube settings, but they are in German & consistent with dialogue.

        -   [Nico's Weg A2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg5P2w_Ro1c&ab_channel=DeutschlernenmitderDW)

        -   [Nico's Weg B1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkufozluseI&t=403s&ab_channel=DeutschlernenmitderDW)\
            (Suggestion: Nico's Weg shouldn't be under "native content". It's designed for non-natives to teach the language.)

        -   [Checker Welt (Reportagen)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXHkZNhCrU2YH4-aqbDrWTFwg-tD0CoyE): A growing playlist of ~190 videos aimed at kids discussing everyday things. CC available. Lots of discussions with various people. Captions are a close approximation.

        -   [Caillou](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRmdnsnElWlSHS5VM2kV4Uw): Children's tv show (Kindergarten age) in imaginable simple german. On youtube with auto generated sub, yet they seem to be accurate

        -   [Bundeswehr's YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Bundeswehr/videos): YT channel of the German Armed Forces. A lot of videos on different, army-related topics, with matching subtitles

    -   Dubbed, no subs

        -   [Miffy](https://www.youtube.com/c/MiffyDeutsch/videos): Dutch children's show dubbed in German, very simple language, free to watch on YouTube. Unlike many other children's shows, this is mostly narrated and includes a lot more literary language than a show driven by character speech; it's more akin to reading a storybook than watching a cartoon. One new learner said it was so comprehensible, "this show straight up cured my inability to understand German". No subs unfortunately, but the auto generated captions on YouTube are pretty good because the narrator speaks very clearly.

    -   Dubbed, Mismatched subs

        -   "[Hilda](https://www.netflix.com/title/80115346)" on Netflix is a great show for beginners that follows the adventures of fearless Hilda, a blue-haired girl who, along with her deerfox Twig, travels to the city of Trolberg, where she conquers even the most dangerous of monsters.

            -   The dub is very high quality with great voices that match the characters. The subs are not consistently wrong; they are accurate about 95% of the time or more.

        -   SpongeBob on Netflix. Subtitles don't match but the content is simple. German sound and subtitles are available without VPN in some regions.

    -   Dubbed with matching subs

        -   "[Trio](https://www.ardmediathek.de/sendung/trio/Y3JpZDovL25kci5kZS80NDU0?isChildContent)" on ARD Mediathek. Norwegian TV show with very clear dubbing and CC subtitles.

### 2C: Mastering a Domain

-   Pure Reading

    -   Services

        -   [International Book Import Service](https://www.ibiservice.com/): Importing German Books to the US. Should be used in tandem with [Buchhandel](https://www.buchhandel.de/) to check for a book's availability.

For help navigating the site or placing an order pm me (Iapetus#6875) on discord

    -   Blogs

        -   [Deutsch Musik Blog](https://deutschmusikblog.de/): a German music blog with short posts usually describing some of the grammar or vocabulary used and sometimes mentions other sources of cultural relevance that appear in the posted song or music video. Posts are even categorized by level such A1, A2, B1, B2 and other useful categories like grammar, phonetics, and literature.

        -   [Fryboyter](https://fryboyter.de/): a blog generally about programming, Linux, and IT. Some posts include English translations. The main page only provides a long list of posts, so you may want to use the [search page](https://fryboyter.de/search/).

    -   Graded Readers

        -   "[Die Weiße Rose](https://www.amazon.com/Die-Wei%C3%9Fe-Rose/dp/3126755151/ref=sr_1_1?crid=R963ZHP13KWZ&dchild=1&keywords=die+weisse+rose&qid=1609176530&sprefix=die+weeis%2Caps%2C272&sr=8-1)" is a simplified short novel that tells the story of a resistance group within the Third Reich. This easy reader is based off of the true story of Hans and Sophie Scholl. There are also movies that are based off of this story (not this book in particular) that might be enjoyable after reading this book.

            -   The company that put together the easy reader claims that the short novel should be comprehensible to German learners at stage A2 (~1200 word vocabulary) and above.

        -   [Learn Out live](https://books.learnoutlive.com/): Collection of graded readers by Andre Klein. You can get audiobook versions and even interactive books (text + spoken audio), and even bundle packs. The pace of the audio is quite moderate and very easy to follow. I read a few of them and really liked them. They also come with extensive vocabulary lists.

    -   Children's Novels

        -   [Kleine Peter in der Katzenstadt](https://www.amazon.com/kleine-Peter-Katzenstadt/dp/3707401898)\
            The story of a young cat named Peter on his first day of cat school. Things do not go well. An old, classic German children's book with delightful illustrations.

    -   Adolescent Novels

        -   [Einmal ](https://www.amazon.de/Einmal-Morris-Gleitzman/dp/3551358621)- Morris Gleitzman

            -   [Einmal: Ausgezeichnet mit dem Katholischen Kinderbuchpreis 2011. Nominiert für den Deutschen Jugendliteraturpreis 2010, Kategorie Preis der Jugendlichen und für den Gustav-Heinemann-Friedenspreis 2010 : Gleitzman, Morris, Gutzschhahn, Uwe-Michael](https://www.amazon.de/Einmal-Morris-Gleitzman/dp/3551358621) Set in WWII Poland, a 9-year-old boy runs away from an orphanage to find his parents who left him there three years ago and in doing so experiences some of the horrors of war.

            -   The book is told in first person by the boy, so the language is relatively basic with no overly complex sentences. It's also short, approx. 250 pages.

    -   Standard Novels

        -   [Supergute Tage oder Die sonderbare Welt des Christopher Boone](https://www.amazon.de/Curious-Incident-Dog-Night-time/dp/0099470438) - Mark Haddon

            -   Translation of the English "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time". It follows a high-functioning autistic 15-year-old who decides to investigate the killing of his neighbour's dog, through which we find out more about Christopher, his family and his view of the world.

            -   The book is narrated in first person and the writing style is very straight forward which can make it quite accessible to intermediate learners. There are small sections where mathematical or scientific things are being explained but the majority of the novel is not at a very high level. A decent choice as a first non-graded-reader novel where you can easily get the gist of the action.

        -   [INFINITUM - Die Ewigkeit der Sterne](https://www.amazon.de/INFINITUM-Die-Ewigkeit-Sterne-Roman-ebook/dp/B086W15YYZ): Exploring new worlds is everything the young researcher Kira Navarez has ever dreamed of. But a harmless mission on a distant planet turns Kira's dream into mankind's greatest nightmare: During the final examination of the planet, which is about to be colonized, Kira falls into a crevice in the rock - and discovers something that no human has ever seen before. It transforms her completely and forever. Kira is alone. Humanity isn't, and we have to find a way to survive.

            -   Available on Audible US). Lower Advanced level; the narrator has a very understandable accent.

Native Content
==============

TV/Movies
---------

-   Netflix: [Full catalogue](https://unogs.com/)

    -   [Dark](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=dark&jbv=80100172): In the aftermath of a child's disappearance, Dark follows characters from the fictional German town of Winden as they pursue the truth. They follow connections between four estranged families to unravel a sinister time travel conspiracy which spans several generations. The series explores the existential implications of time, and its effect on human nature.

        -   In terms of difficulty, Dark is an upper intermediate show. The vocab is very recurring and the accents are not hard to understand. Time travel can make the plot confusing.

    -   "Bad Banks" is a series about a young woman in the banking industry in frankfurt. Don't know how hard it is to understand, but it's a great series in any case!.

    -   [Stromberg](https://www.myspass.de/shows/tvshows/stromberg/#bob-subnavi) is the german version of "The Office". I haven't watched it yet, but it seems like a valid resource.

    -   Charité on Netflix is amazing! Easy/ intermediate vocabulary, I especially enjoyed it for the scientific and medical terms.

    -   Dogs of Berlin: Pretty indulgent series about crooked cops and the criminal underbelly of Berlin. Presents a (rather grim) picture of modern day German city life. Good for contemporary colloquial speech patterns and slang.

    -   [Türkisch für Anfänger](https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/80125201): with three seasons, this comedy series tells the story of a new German-Turkish couple who decides to move in together in Berlin. Since both have children prior to dating, it focuses a lot on the cultural clashes between the two families. It should be easy to follow even without understanding the language.

    -   [Ku'damm](https://www.zdf.de/serien/kudamm): with seasons taking place in 1956 (Ku'damm 56), 1959 (Ku'damm 59), and 1963 (Ku'damm 63), it is a mini series following a family living in and leading a dance school in the rich Berliner neighborhood of Kurfürstendamm. Since it's focused on their day to day lives at that time, it's an interesting introduction to the historical period in the city and has a bit more formal German than a 2000's comedy.

    -   [Der Tatortreiniger](https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/80011356): it is generally appraised as an excellent comedy series (it's only a welcoming coincidence that it's in German). Each episode tells about a day of work of Schotty, a crime-scene cleaner. It's not for beginners, but it's funny anyway.

    -   [Mord mit Aussicht](https://www.netflix.com/title/80000587): it's generally the top recommendation of a German series not from Netflix. Not my cup of tea, but it's part of German's love for crime stories. It's a comedy series of a detective taking the leading job of a police station in a small town.

    -   [Freud](https://www.netflix.com/title/80209184): Odd show that pits young Sigmund Freud against supernatural forces. Mostly accurate subs. Spoken in Viennese dialect. Late 1800s period show. Lots of mystery, violence and deviant sensuality to keep the viewer interested.

    -   [Babylon Berlin](https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=80136321) : Babylon Berlin is a crime and political drama set in late 1920s Berlin. It follows Gereon Rath, an inspector from Köln with a secret agenda and Charlotte Ritter, a young woman who aims to become a homicide detective. The subtitles are mostly accurate, and the accents are not difficult to understand. However, there is some specialised vocabulary and the show is quite complex + fast paced, so probably best for upper-intermediate learners.

    -   [The Empress](https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/81222923): Based on the life of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (a.k.a Sisi), tells the story of a rebellious Bavarian princess who marries the Austrian king and the struggles in the royal family. The language contains old phrases occasionally but is mostly understandable and the characters don't speak too fast. Subtitles match 90% of the time.

-   Other:

    -   [Verliebt in Berlin](https://www.sixx.de/tv/verliebt-in-berlin/video/verliebt-in-berlin-alle-folgen-online-ansehen?rw=1115100876&cmpUcId=1bb0809e92dad2c7d387da6c057cae87701fb7f7b5b21f4ea48c1f9a35c4f2ea): Based on the telenovela that inspired Ugly Betty, Verliebt in Berlin follows Lisa as she starts a new Job in a fashion firm. The show is a telenovela with over 600 episodes, 24 minutes each, no subtitles. Lots of everyday, slice of life dialog with no heavy accents and spoken clearly. The plot is fairly straightforward and easy to follow, as well as being a seemingly endless resource. (Geoblocked, German VPN required)

    -   [DRUCK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr5zglOqHZAEfCcAx_nw1dQ): Remake of the Norwegian SKAM series, DRUCK follows a group of teens in their final years of school and touches on many social issues relevant today. "Love, friendship and one's own identity", the series is widely praised and recommended to not just teens. It's currently in its 8th season, 10 episodes per season of 20-30 minute, all with full subtitles. Very colloquial, natural speech.

-   [s.to](https://s.to/): Contains hundreds of different german dubbed and/or subbed shows including anime (lots of anime), western animation, action films, comedies, documentaries, dramas, history, horror, and many others. Not all are dubbed.

    -   [Deutscher](https://www.zdf.de/serien/deutscher/tage-wie-diese-104.html) - A fictitious portrayal of modern Germany and the everyday consequences on people if an extreme right-wing party suddenly ruled the country. It follows the life of two families who have been neighbors for years. They each have an only-child son who are best friends and the adults help each other out now and then. When the victory of an extreme right-wing party wins an election, one family celebrates while the other is distraught.

-   Novels

    -   „[Das Parfum˝](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3257228007/ref=x_gr_w_bb_glide_sout?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_w_bb_glide_sout-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=3257228007&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2)- Patrick Süskind (available as an ebook)

        -   The story follows Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, an unloved orphan in 18th-century France who is born with an exceptional sense of smell, capable of distinguishing a vast range of scents in the world around him. Grenouille becomes a perfumer but later becomes involved in murder when he encounters a young girl with an unsurpassed wondrous scent. If you are a fan of shocking endings, you will most likely enjoy this book.

        -   „Das Parfum˝ is definitely an upper level advanced book, but most of the vocab is recurring, so with a few hours of grinding in the beginning the rest is very manageable. Even though the novel was written in the 20th century, it definitely has a bit of an older/stilted feel to it.

    -   „[Der Rumpf˝](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/344242366X/ref=x_gr_w_bb_sout?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_w_bb_sout-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=344242366X&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2)- Akif Pirinçci (Amazon is linked but I would recommend using the [International Book Import Service](https://www.ibiservice.com/))

        -   „Der Rumpf˝ is the incredible life confession of an ingenious murderer, a man who has only one goal: to commit the perfect murder. A dazzling and exciting, evil and clever, funny and profound book and a thriller like you have never read before.

        -   „Der Rumpf˝ is an upper level advanced book similar to „Das Parfum˝. Much of the vocab is recurring but not as much so as in some other books.

    -   [„Das weiße Land der Seele" ](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Kharitidi/dp/3548746519/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=das+weisse+land+der+seele&qid=1616251903&sr=8-1)- Olga Kharitidi (Amazon page is linked)

        -   Joining an ailing friend on a spontaneous trip to the Altai Mountains, Dr. Kharitidi is taken into apprenticeship by a native Shaman who guides her through bizarre, magical, and often terrifying experiences that open her eyes to a wellspring of deeper learning. On the road to Belovedia, a fabled civilization of highly evolved beings, she encounters revolutionary mystical teachings while discovering ancient secrets of magic and healing. At once a modern odyssey and a timeless dreamscape, Entering the Circle is an inspiring story of personal growth and an insightful work about the limitless potential of human spirit.

        -   „Das weiße Land der Seele" is more of an intermediate book. Mid-level, stage 2B learners should be able to handle this book relatively well. The translation is very high quality and does not take away from the book at all.

    -   [„Die Blechtrommel"](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/G%C3%BCnter-Grass/dp/3958291309/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=die+blechtrommel&qid=1616252329&sr=8-2) - Günter Grass (Amazon page is linked)

        -   Oskar Matzerath is a child whose mental development is already complete at birth. At the age of three, he decides not to grow up. The grotesque outsider looks at the world with a relentlessly sarcastic gaze 'from below'. His constant companion is a tin drum. If it is taken from him, he defends himself with a scream that shatters glass. As strange as the angry dwarf is, he is free. Oskar is a relentlessly astute observer of the Danzig petty bourgeoisie in the 'Third Reich'. He sees through everything, but he does not intervene.

        -   „Die Blechtrommel" is broken up into 3 books for a total of nearly 1000 pages. All 3 books are definitely upper advanced and will be difficult for anyone below 2C. The sentence structure is not too difficult, but the vocab is very advanced for a literary novel.

    -   [„Rico, Oskar und die Tieferschatten"](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Andreas-Steinh%C3%B6fel/dp/3551310297/ref=sr_1_1?crid=OOQN1NOBHB2N&dchild=1&keywords=oskar+und+die+tieferschatten&qid=1616252999&sprefix=oskar%2Caps%2C399&sr=8-1) - Andreas Steinhöfel (Amazon page linked)

        -   Rico is only supposed to keep a vacation diary, but as someone who constantly loses his train of thought, it's not so easy! When Rico meets Oskar, the two of them decide to follow the trail of the notorious ALDI kidnapper. Along the way, Rico loses his grasp on what is real and what isn't. With Oskar by his side, the Tieferschatten (read the book to understand) lose some of their terror - and so a wonderful friendship develops out of all the chaos.

        -   „Rico, Oskar und die Tieferschatten" is a late beginner novel of about 230 pages. This book is good for learners (2A-2B) who have maybe read a book or two in German before but are still getting into reading. This is a children's book, but it should be enjoyable for people of all ages.

    -   [Frank Schätzing - Der Schwarm](https://gofile.io/d/fQmBJl) (The Swarm): Whales begin sinking ships. Toxic, eyeless crabs poison Long Island's water supply. The North Sea shelf collapses, killing thousands in Europe. Around the world, countries are beginning to feel the effects of the ocean's revenge as the seas and their inhabitants begin a violent revolution against mankind. At stake is the survival of the Earth's fragile ecology---and ultimately, the survival of the human race itself.

    -   [Siddhartha](https://www.amazon.de/Siddhartha-indische-Dichtung-Hermann-Hesse/dp/3518366823/) by Herman Hesse. Follows a young man on a journey of self discovery. Buddhist themes. Critically acclaimed.

    -   [Schachnovelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Game) by Stefan Zweig. An Austrian man detained by the Nazis maintains his sanity by obsessively reading a secret chess guidebook and playing mental games against himself to the point of chess mastery.
