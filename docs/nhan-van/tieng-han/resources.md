-   Dramas\
    Here are some dramas that are easier to understand. Usually the first episode or two are noticeably more difficult than the rest, because they're doing so much backstory for the characters and the plot.

    -   Meow, the Secret Boy

    -   Mother (series, not movie)

    -   Another Miss Oh

    -   To the Beautiful You

    -   Thirty But Seventeen

    -   Just Between Lovers

    -   Encounter

    -   Into the World Again

    -   Who Are You

    -   Beautiful World

    -   Moment of Eighteen

    -   My Holo Love (once you get past the first episode)

    -   Are You Human Too (once you get past the first episode)

    -   Cheer up!

    -   Summer Strike

    -   [KBS classic drama](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn0nlepACCBD6rxj-GUwn5A) channel on YouTube

-   Monolingual Dictionaries

    -   [Naver 국어사전](https://ko.dict.naver.com/#/main)includes 표준국어대사전, 고려대사전, and 우리말샘. Its examples are weaker than its KR-EN counterpart, but it features a nice graph showing synonyms and antonyms for words as well as etymology and links to articles on correct usage.

    -   [기초사전](https://krdict.korean.go.kr/mainAction)'s monolingual definitions are considerably easier to understand than the ones on monolingual Naver, and the frequency rating is more consistent. (The top definitions of every word are available for Migaku dictionary.)

    -   [다음사전](https://dic.daum.net/), an alternative to Naver 국어사전 made by Kakao. It doesn't have frequency stars, but it has more example sentences and an arguably better interface

    -   [Open Dictionary 우리말샘](https://opendict.korean.go.kr/main)is a dictionary that is being edited and updated by users online, much like a wiki, so it is a great place to look for newer words.

    -   The National Institute of Korean Language [국립국어원](https://www.korean.go.kr/front/main.do) has made available the [Great Dictionary of Standard Korean 표준국어대사전](https://stdict.korean.go.kr/main/main.do), which includes locus classicus, where available, in addition to pronunciation and conjugation guidance.

    -   The National Institute of Korean Language also hosts a [website defining the official spelling rules for Korean](https://kornorms.korean.go.kr//regltn/regltnView.do#a), a message board where [they accept and reply to usage/spelling questions on Korean](https://www.korean.go.kr/front/onlineQna/onlineQnaList.do?mn_id=216) from native speakers to give them the definitive answers on how the language should be used, and another site with the [official pronunciation rules for Korean](https://kornorms.korean.go.kr/regltn/regltnView.do?regltn_code=0002&regltn_no=346#a346).

    -   [KoreanA2z ](http://old.koreaa2z.com/kd/lang.htm)has an online dictionary tracing the etymology through history of something like 3,000 native Korean words.

    -   [Hanja-ro](http://hanjaro.juntong.or.kr/text_translater.aspx?hu=1) will take a Korean text as input and will output the same text but with all syllables that have a hanja equivalent in hanja. Note that it does not take context into account so you only get the hanja of the most common word in the case of homonyms. Learners coming from Japanese especially like to use this as an intermediate tool to aid with reading.

    -   [Wikipedia's list](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD%EC%9D%98_%EC%9D%B8%ED%84%B0%EB%84%B7_%EC%8B%A0%EC%A1%B0%EC%96%B4_%EB%AA%A9%EB%A1%9D) of Korean internet neologisms

    -   And, if you've decided to study hanja, [Naver's hanja dictionary](https://hanja.dict.naver.com/) will be an invaluable resource, with handwriting input, lists of words using each character, and etymology information

    -   Dictionary of [Korean regional speech](https://wordrow.kr/%EC%82%AC%ED%88%AC%EB%A6%AC/%EC%A0%84%EA%B5%AD/%EB%AA%A8%EB%93%A0%ED%92%88%EC%82%AC/) 사투리

### 2C: Mastering a Domain

-   Pure Reading

    -   Reading Tools

        -   [Vocab Tracker](https://www.vocabtracker.com/getpage/Auth/Login) and [Korean Reader](https://koreanreader.com/) are Lingq-inspired online reading webpages designed to help you read Korean more efficiently. Some will like them and some will hate them because of the inability of these systems to show the root form of conjugated words or words with suffixes. Give it a try and see if it is something you will like.

        -   [Reader ttsu](https://github.com/ttu-ttu/ebook-reader) is an online book reader that supports browser extensions like Yomichan. It can be helpful for linux users (when finding a good-looking epub reader can be difficult), and it can be installed/self--hosted, if one doesn't have an internet connection all the time.

    -   Blogs

        -   This blog has some thoughts on how to [DIY your own graded readers](https://www.mykoreanramblings.com/2014/04/10/thoughts-on-make-your-own-reader/)

    -   Graded Readers

        -   [Routledge](https://amzn.to/2OZW1Y0) and [Olly Richards](https://amzn.to/3ffE3uY) have reading materials for intermediate learners

        -   The grammar website [How to Study Korean](https://www.howtostudykorean.com/buyingpdf/short-stories/) has a handful of stories available for purchase as PDF files for intermediate learners

        -   [Korean Lab](http://www.koreanlab.co.kr/primary/p_index.asp?t_id=3), part of the Yulchon Foundation, has mixed-script readings for Korean children that are organized by grade (elementary grades 1-6, [middle school](http://www.koreanlab.co.kr/middle/m_index.asp?t_id=4) grades 1-3 and [high school](http://www.koreanlab.co.kr/high/h_index.asp?t_id=5) has many readings organized by topic)

    -   Children's Novels

        -   [Sherlock Holmes](https://ridibooks.com/books/687000036) A series of 10 books, each containing several Sherlock Holmes stories. The language has been simplified to be accessible to children.

    -   Adolescent Novels

        -   [아몬드](https://ridibooks.com/books/754020527) A story about a boy who has Alexithymia, a condition that makes it hard for him to feel emotions. This is a great read. A bit dark, and the author sometimes takes roundabout ways to tell the story.

    -   Standard Books/Novels

        -   Many Korean books are readily available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/books).

        -   Many community members are choosing to read the WebNovel [사라진 아이 ](https://novel.naver.com/best/list.nhn?novelId=924539)[*The Child who Disappeared*](https://novel.naver.com/best/list.nhn?novelId=924539), by Lim Geon, on Naver Novels as a relatively easy book to start reading after finishing the Yonsei readers

        -   The webnovel series [나는 아직 살아있다](https://ridibooks.com/books/2749005088) is a zombie apocalypse / survival story set in Seoul. It's 12 books long, has lots of repetition and fairly short sentences. However, be warned. The author is completely unable to write decent characters. The men fight, the women cry and scream and cook and protect the children. The women and children are so poorly developed as characters that most of the time you forget that they're even there. Also, there are extremely long scenes where the only thing that happens is that the main character is frightened. For 20 pages at a time. At the start of the series it's pretty good fun, but the flaws become unbearable by around book 3 or 4.
