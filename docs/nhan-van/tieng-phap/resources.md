General Advice
--------------

### From Casey:

I just want to make a personal suggestion about learning the French language that I don't know where it belongs in these stages in the Refold Program. But french slang or argots is important in my eyes to advancing your French skills. Also idiomatic phrases and expressions are key but again I don't know where to really place these things. I apologize nonetheless.

### From: Charlie Chaplin

Alternative pathway for beginners

If you're a beginner with French and having trouble following the Refold method, you can usually find a French beginners course (book and audio) at a public library. The course will take care of grammar and some of the initial vocabulary you will need. You should still consider doing the first 300 word Anki deck alongside the course.

To adapt a course to Refold, you should:

-   Not try to speak the language out loud (just listen and notice the sounds)

-   Not translate into your target language

-   Not try to memorise anything or understand everything 100% (just keep moving on to the next lesson each day or two)

For example, you could get the Assimil book and audio (or app). The book tells you to read the text aloud and later translate from English into French, but you should ignore these instructions. Just listen to each lesson, then read the text and listen again. The next day, move on to the next lesson.

Half way through the course, Assimil says to do a second wave where you go back and translate the first lessons from English into French. Don't translate, just listen to the lessons again and make sentence cards in Anki for any words that are still unfamiliar. At this point you should start to immerse with easy media, like Alice Ayel on YouTube.

Learning expressions:

A lot of French expressions are hard to look up in the dictionary. Example: You come across this phrase...= J'y peux rien. To look this up, you need to search for...= Ne rien y pouvoir. [Inner French](https://innerfrench.com/frenchphrases/) has a useful guide to expressions and slang. It has audio and English translations. Worth sentence mining in stage 2.
